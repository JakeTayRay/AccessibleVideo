Hello everyone, my name is Jacob Taylor and I'll be walking you through the Portfolio page that I did for assignment one.

2
00:00:10.001 --> 00:00:35.000
Please go to github and netlify and make sure you are signed into both of these as we will be using them for this project.

3
00:00:35.001 --> 00:01:04.000
Next step is to search for Jekyll Netlify and go to the templates page you see in your google search and then select the first template.

4
00:01:04.001 --> 00:01:50.000
You will have to connect to your github, and then name the repository identical to your github username.

5
00:01:50.001 --> 00:02:15.000
After you have created the repository you will have to wait for the site to deploy.

6
00:02:15.001 --> 00:03:30.000
Change your site name on Netlify to the same as your Github name you just created and change the Github Repository name to include .github.io after your username.

7
00:03:30.001 --> 00:04:14.000
You should now see the website if you navigate to it in your url bar and you can go to the admin page to edit content.

00:04:14.001 --> 00:04:24.000
Please let me know if you have any questions or concerns about this!
